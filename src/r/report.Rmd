# Introduction

It is a well-known fact that motor skills and reflexes of adults deteriorate with age. In this report we explore the relationship between the age and performance of Formula 1 (F1) drivers through Bayesian data analysis. In particular, we consider three models: separate, pooled, and hierarchical. The models incorporate weakly priors, and related discussion of choices and sensitivity analysis is provided for each model separately.

# Data

The raw data is provided by the [@ergast]. TODO: discuss preprocessing and analysis problem. The same underlying data has been utilized by various authors. For example, [@nigro2021] examines how odds provided by a neural network model fit to a subset of the data fares against officially provided odds. The author also notes that the age of the winning driver shows a decreasing linear trend.
