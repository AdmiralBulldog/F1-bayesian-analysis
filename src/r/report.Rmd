# Introduction

Formula One (F1) is the most prestigious auto racing league in the world. The number of drivers in this racing class is only 20, and those taking part could be considered "the best of the best". Given the fierce level of competition, every attribute of the driver could be considered important. An F1 driver must be at least 18 years of age, that is, the participating racers are all adults. It is a well-known fact that motor skills and reflexes of adults deteriorate with age. In this report we explore the relationship between the age and performance of F1 drivers through Bayesian analysis. In particular, we consider and compare three models: separate, pooled, and hierarchical. The models incorporate weakly priors, and related discussion of choices and sensitivity analysis is provided for each model separately. We further conduct posterior predictive analysis and finally provide a discussion on the models and potential future research.

# Data

The raw data is provided by the [@ergast]. TODO: discuss pre-processing. Our analysis problem revolves around extracting posterior statistics yielding information about the relationship between a driver's age and performance. An example of such statistic would be the probability that the best age performance-wise lies within a certain range.

The same underlying data has been utilized by various authors. For example, [@nigro2021] examines how odds provided by a neural network model fit to a subset of the data fares against officially provided odds. Related to our analysis, the author notes that the age of the winning driver shows a decreasing linear trend. [@jain2020] on the other hand utilizes logistic regression with $F_1$ score to predict whether or not a driver manages to place on podium, i.e., to attain a top-three position. Similar to us, [@vankesteren2021] conducts a Bayesian analysis. The author models the skill of drivers considering factors including constructor advantages and seasonal constructor form. In contrast, our analysis is solely based on exploring whether or not a driver's age provides meaningful insight on his performance.

# Models

In this section we enumerate and describe the three models we attempt to fit to the data described previously. Let us first define some general prerequisites. Let $N$ denote the size of the dataset. Further, let $\mathcal{I} = \left\{1, 2, \dots, N\right\}$ denote the index set of the dataset, and $\mathcal{A} = \left\{18, 19, \dots, 43\right\}$ the set of driver ages present in the dataset. Now let $\text{age}(\cdot)$ be a mapping from $\mathcal{I}$ to $\mathcal{A}$ yielding the age of the sample at index $i \in \mathcal{I}$.

## Separate

The separate model is formally defined as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
t_i &\sim \mathrm{N}(\mu_{\text{age}(i)}, \sigma_{\text{age}(i)}), \\
\mu_{\text{age}(i)} &\sim \mathrm{N}(0,1), \\
\sigma_{\text{age}(i)} &\sim \mathrm{N}(0,1).
\end{aligned}
$$

The separate model effectively assumes the defining characteristics of the distribution for $t_i$ are different for each age group.

## Pooled

The pooled model is formally defined as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
t_i &\sim \mathrm{N}(\mu, \sigma), \\
\mu &\sim \mathrm{N}(0,1), \\
\sigma &\sim \mathrm{N}(0,1).
\end{aligned}
$$

The pooled model simply assumes the characteristics of the distribution generating $t_i$ are independent of driver age.

## Hierarchical

Finally, the hierarchical model is defined as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
t_i &\sim \mathrm{N}(\mu_{\text{age}(i)}, \sigma), \\
\mu_{\text{age}(i)} &\sim \mathrm{N}(\mu_{\text{unknown}}, \tau), \\
\mu_{\text{unknown}} &\sim \mathrm{N}(0, 10), \\
\tau &\sim \mathrm{N}(0, 10), \\
\sigma &\sim \mathrm{N}(0, 10).
\end{aligned}
$$

In the hierarchical model, the variance of the distribution describing $t_i$ is assumed the same for each age group. However, the mean of this distribution is assumed to be dependent on age. The parameters of the distribution yielding the mean of a particular age group are further sampled from the hyperpriors described above.
