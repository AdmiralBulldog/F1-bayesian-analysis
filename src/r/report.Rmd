# Introduction

It is a well-known fact that motor skills and reflexes of adults deteriorate with age. In this report we explore the relationship between the age and performance of Formula 1 (F1) drivers. We conduct a Bayesian data analysis on F1 data provided by the Ergast Developer API [@ergast]. In particular, we consider three models describing the data: separate, pooled, and hierarchical. The models incorporate weakly priors, and related discussion of choices and sensitivity analysis is provided for each model separately.
