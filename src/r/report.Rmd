# Introduction

It is a well-known fact that motor skills and reflexes of adults deteriorate with age. In this report we explore the relationship between the age and performance of Formula One (F1) drivers through Bayesian analysis. In particular, we consider three models: separate, pooled, and hierarchical. The models incorporate weakly priors, and related discussion of choices and sensitivity analysis is provided for each model separately.

# Data

The raw data is provided by the [@ergast]. TODO: discuss pre-processing. Our analysis problem revolves around extracting posterior statistics yielding information about the relationship between a driver's age and performance. An example of such statistic would be the probability that the best age performance-wise lies within a certain range.

The same underlying data has been utilized by various authors. For example, [@nigro2021] examines how odds provided by a neural network model fit to a subset of the data fares against officially provided odds. Related to our analysis, the author notes that the age of the winning driver shows a decreasing linear trend. [@jain2020] on the other hand utilizes logistic regression with $F_1$ score to predict whether or not a driver manages to place on podium, i.e., to attain a top-three position. Similar to us, [@vankesteren2021] conducts a Bayesian analysis. The author models the skill of drivers considering factors including constructor advantages and seasonal constructor form. In contrast, our analysis is solely based on exploring whether or not a driver's age provides meaningful insight on his performance.
